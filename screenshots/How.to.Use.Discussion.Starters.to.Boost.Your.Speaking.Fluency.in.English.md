## How to Use Discussion Starters?
  
Using discussion starters is easy and simple. All you need is a partner or a group of people who are willing to talk in English. You can use discussion starters with your classmates, friends, family members, teachers, or online language partners. You can also use them in formal or informal settings, such as in the classroom, at home, at work, or at a social event.
  
Here are some tips on how to use discussion starters effectively:

- Pick a topic that interests you and your partner(s). You can choose from a wide range of topics, such as hobbies, sports, movies, music, culture, travel, education, health, politics, etc.
- Select a discussion starter that is appropriate for the topic and the situation. You can use open-ended questions that invite more than one answer, such as "What do you think about...?", "How do you feel about...?", "What are some advantages and disadvantages of...?", etc. You can also use hypothetical scenarios that stimulate your imagination, such as "What would you do if...?", "How would you react if...?", "What if...?", etc.
- Ask the discussion starter to your partner(s) and listen carefully to their response(s). Try to show interest and curiosity by nodding, smiling, making eye contact, and using positive feedback words, such as "That's interesting", "I agree", "I see", etc.
- Respond to the discussion starter with your own opinion or experience. Try to elaborate on your answer by giving reasons, examples, facts, or stories. Avoid giving short or vague answers, such as "Yes", "No", "Maybe", etc.
- Ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation going. You can ask for more details, clarification, or explanation by using words like "Why?", "How?", "When?", "Where?", etc. You can also ask for opinions or preferences by using words like "Which?", "Who?", "What?", etc.
- Respect the opinions and experiences of your partner(s). You don't have to agree with everything they say, but you should avoid arguing or criticizing them. Instead, you can express your disagreement politely by using phrases like "I respect your opinion, but...", "I see your point, but...", "I have a different perspective on...", etc.
