1. Check if you have a valid Archicad 16, Archicad 16 TRIAL, or Archicad 16 DEMO installation on your computer[^1^].
2. Locate the desired language and OS version in the list below (MEP Modeler Download Packages) and download the installer[^1^].
3. Start the Installer. Important: When installing MEP Modeler, you must be logged on as a member of the Administrator Group. For Windows users: Java 6 is required to run installer/uninstaller. If you do not have Java 6 on your system, it will be automatically installed when you start installing MEP Modeler[^1^].
4. The MEP Modeler installer wizard will help you through the installation. You will need to define a location on your computerâs hard drive for installing MEP Modeler. You can either point to an existing folder or create a new folder[^1^].
5. In order to try MEP Modeler without a license under a licensed Archicad 16, you need to run Archicad 16 in DEMO mode. Unplug the WIBU dongle prior to launching Archicad to switch to DEMO mode[^1^].

If you decide to purchase an MEP Modeler license, please contact your local Archicad reseller[^1^]. Product licenses may be uploaded to the Archicad protection key via the internet. After obtaining the license to the MEP Modeler you have already installed, it is going to work under your licensed Archicad 16 with full functionality[^1^].

Benefits of MEP Modeler for Archicad 16
MEP Modeler for Archicad 16 is a powerful tool that can help you design and coordinate mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems within your architectural model. Some of the benefits of using MEP Modeler are:
<ul>
<li>You can create and edit 3D models of ductworks, pipeworks, cable trays and other MEP elements using parametric objects from a vast library[^1^] [^2^]. You can also save your own custom MEP parts as library objects[^2^].</li>
<li>You can use the MEP Routing Palette to easily draw and connect MEP elements with automatic junctions and fittings[^2^]. You can also use the Edit MEP Selection Set command to modify multiple elements at once[^2^].</li>
<li>You can check and resolve collisions between MEP elements and other building components using the Collision Detection function[^2^]. You can also use the Opening Tool to create openings for MEP elements in walls, slabs, roofs and other structures[^2^].</li>
<li>You can exchange MEP models with other disciplines using IFC format[^2^]. You can also import and export MEP data using Excel or XML formats[^2^].</li>
<li>You can visualize and document your MEP design using Archicad's 3D views, sections, elevations, schedules and layouts[^2^]. You can also use Archicad's rendering and animation tools to create realistic presentations of your MEP systems[^2^].</li>
</ul>
